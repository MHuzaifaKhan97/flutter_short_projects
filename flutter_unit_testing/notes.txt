What is testing?
 - Ensuring our app does exactly what it should.
 - Testing for regressions
 - Two types:
    - manual testing.
    - Automated test.

Tests in flutter:
- Unit Test.
 - For all code beside the UI widget.
 - One set of unit tests usually tests a single class.

- Widget Test.
 - For testing a single widget.

- Integration Test.
 - For testing large part of the app from the user perspective.
